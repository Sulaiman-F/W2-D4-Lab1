                <p><b>Summary:</b> "The final and greatest utterance of the human mind." -- Fyodor Dostoyevsky. A
                    founding work of modern Western literature, Cervantes' masterpiece has been translated into more
                    than 60 languages and the novel's elderly knight, Don Quixote, and his loyal squire, Sancho Panza,
                    rank among fiction's most recognized characters. This monumental parody of chivalric romances and
                    epic of heroic idealism presents a strikingly contemporary narrative that also reflects the
                    historical realities of 17th century Spain"</p>

                <p><b>Summary:</b> "Michael Patrick Hearn, acclaimed for The Annotated Wizard of Oz, provides an
                    in-depth exploration of Twain's Huckleberry Finn, examining its literary, social, and historical
                    contexts. His lively annotations draw on various sources, revealing the novel's complex history and
                    its status as one of the most banned books in America. Characters such as Jim, Widow Douglas, and
                    Miss Watson come to life against the backdrop of the Mississippi River, which serves as a central,
                    untamable force. Hearn highlights how the novel redefined literature and transformed global
                    perspectives on storytelling."</p>

                <p><b>Summary:</b> "The adventures of a mischievous young boy and his friends growing up in a
                    Mississippi
                    River town in the nineteenth century. Who could forget the pranks, the adventures, the sheer fun of
                    Tom Sawyer? It's something every child should experience and every child will love. From Tom's sly
                    trickery with the whitewashed fence, when he cleverly manipulates everyone so they happily do his
                    work for him, to his and Becky Thatcher's calamities in Bat Cave, the enjoyment just never ends."
