                <p><b>Summary:</b> "The final and greatest utterance of the human mind." -- Fyodor Dostoyevsky. A
                    founding work of modern Western literature, Cervantes' masterpiece has been translated into more
                    than 60 languages and the novel's elderly knight, Don Quixote, and his loyal squire, Sancho Panza,
                    rank among fiction's most recognized characters. This monumental parody of chivalric romances and
                    epic of heroic idealism presents a strikingly contemporary narrative that also reflects the
                    historical realities of 17th century Spain"</p>

                <p><b>Summary:</b> "Michael Patrick Hearn, author of the national bestseller The Annotated Wizard of Oz,
                    has done equal justice to this great American novel. A Twain literary sleuth and an authority on
                    children's literature, he considers all the literary, social, historical, and autobiographical
                    aspects of Twain's classic tale of Huck and Jim's trip down the mighty Mississippi. In lively and
                    fascinating annotations, Hearn's notes draw on everything from letters, manuscripts, and
                    contemporary newspapers to the author's own frequent revisions and notes, various critical responses
                    to the publication, and much previously unpublished material. The substantial introduction is, in
                    essence, a mini-biography of a book and a man whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens
                    (1835-1910), and it recounts the novel's remarkably prickly history, resulting in its being banned
                    perhaps more than any other work in American history." "In this new edition, the characters of
                    Hannibal, Missouri, come vividly alive, as if Hearn was steering the raft itself. We encounter,
                    among others, the kindhearted Widow Douglas, the dreaded Miss Watson; the enlightened runaway slave
                    Jim, whom Huck meets on Jackson's Island; an endless parade of thieves, slaveowners, and sheer
                    opportunists; as well as Tom Sawyer and Aunt Sally, whose desire to adopt and "sivilize" Huck
                    propels him to flee to the American West. Likewise, the Mississippi River "emerges as a living force
                    regardless of the vain attempts of men to tame it." Hearn, by illustrating literary and historical
                    themes that we never knew before, demonstrates that Huckleberry Finn did more than merely redefine
                    the "bad-boy's book"; it galvanized and transformed world literature."</p>

                    Mississippi
                    River town in the nineteenth century. Who could forget the pranks, the adventures, the sheer fun of
                    Tom Sawyer? It's something every child should experience and every child will love. From Tom's sly
                    trickery with the whitewashed fence, when he cleverly manipulates everyone so they happily do his
                    work for him, to his and Becky Thatcher's calamities in Bat Cave, the enjoyment just never ends."
